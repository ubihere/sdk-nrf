SUPL lib 0.7.2
**************

* Fixed compilation error with Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) enabled.
* Improved timeout handling.
* Improved error handling. supl_client_session() now returns success if assistance data is
  received and injected successfully, even if ending the SUPL session gracefully fails.

SUPL lib 0.7.1
**************

* Added soft-float build of the library.
* Fixed cell ID encoding in the sent request, so that the server can determine the location of the
  device and send a reference location back to the device. The MCC table is used as a fall back in
  case no reference location is received from the server.
* Reference location is now only injected if it was requested.
* Fixed usage of an IPv6 address as the device ID.
* Removed the dependency to the modem library (modemlib). This version works with both modem library
  and bsdlib.

SUPL lib 0.7.0
**************

* Updated library so that it will work with the new modem library (modemlib),
  this version will not work with bsdlib. For bsdlib support, version 0.6.1
  must be used.
